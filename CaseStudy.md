Emirates NBD (ENBD), one of the largest banks in the United Arab Emirates, partnered with McKinsey & Company to transform into an AI and advanced analytics-driven organization, aiming to unlock operational efficiency, boost customer engagement, and lead the digital transformation of banking in the Middle East.

The bank tackled the challenge of shifting from traditional long-cycle analytics projects to lean, iterative delivery models that produce measurable business outcomes. 
This shift required improving data infrastructure, honing development processes, standardizing model governance, and scaling analytics capabilities across the organization.

To support transformation, ENBD focused on building internal talent by hiring more than 70 analytics and strategy professionals and reskilling existing staff for roles including delivery leads and data engineers. 
The bank also created programs with McKinsey Academy, such as generative AI hackathons, to develop broader internal capabilities and nurture an AI-driven community.

A key element of the transformation was building a robust analytics stack that included an automated continuous integration/continuous delivery framework, a feature store for machine-learning model observability, and a model validation framework that ensured reproducibility and compliance across analytics use cases.

ENBD deployed more than 100 advanced analytics and AI models within two years to support business functions including hyper-personalized customer engagement, predictive insights for relationship managers, and improved operational decision-making.
